## About Me

Hello! I'm Nhi. I'm an undergraduate student studying Mathematics, Data Science, and Chinese at St. Olaf College. I love learning about text and sentiment analysis and predictive models for transportation-related problems.
My journey in data science has just begun and I'm very excited to see what's ahead!

Outside of academia, I collect a lot of Lego sets and my favorite themes are Architecture and Technic. I also like to travel abroad as well.
