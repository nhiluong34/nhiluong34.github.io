We can also see that none of the American airlines made it to top five even though they are in the top five of word counts. So let us take a deeper dive into the US airlines to see what the customers are saying!"

Its influence in the US specifically is undeniable as many Korean cultural products have become a part of the collective mainstream cultural landscape from Kpop music groups like BTS and Black Pink to the critically and commercially acclaimed show: Squid Game.

These media provide a medium for many during and after the pandemics where the same sentiments of the public resonate with the message of these shows. How do South Korean shows make such an impact? What can we learn from one of the Four Asian Tigers 2 cultural production and publishing’s history and journey? In this project, we want to explore “Which original network has the highest number of Korean drama series on weekdays and weekends, and how does it compare to other days of the week?” and “Which original network has the highest variation in IMDb ratings, and how does it compare to others in terms of the median rating?” .\n\n\nBut how popular is the Korean Wave with its cultural products of television that have taken the world by storm and especially in the West? We would like to touch the surface of the Kdrama popularity through the IMDb rating of these shows while comparing them between networks to assess such impact. Here, we define original network of a show as a broadcasting channel that invests in the show and airs it first.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: IMDb Ratings distribution by Original Networks for Korean Dramas.This box plot illustrates the distribution of IMDb ratings for Korean dramas produced by 20 original networks. The data reveal that most networks have median ratings between 6 and 8. Netflix stands out with the highest median rating, while Naver TV Cast has the lowest. Outliers are present across several networks, suggesting significant variability in ratings for some shows. The data were collected from mydramalist.com and include IMDb ratings for 810 dramas spanning from 2002 to 2022. The figure provides a descriptive overview of users rating.\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\nWe explore the IMDb ratings distribution across 21 Korean original networks and see that Netflix has the highest median IMDb ratings, surpassing national public networks such as KBS, SBS, and MBC by half a point. Among these original networks, Netflix is one of a few original network that is a streaming service, but it is doing very well. As Netflix is a global streaming service, this suggests Netflix’s original Korean dramas are doing very well and receiving a lot of attention from global audience. This relates to the concept of soft power we discuss in the introduction where Korean culture and values are getting recognition from the international level.\n\n\n\n\nOne way to examine the strategy to their success would be through the classic strategy of TV networks in their choice of aired day to be competitive with other networks. We will visualized that concept through the top 10 original networks below.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Number of Korean Drama Series by Days of the Week Across Top 10 Original Networks. This chart shows that KBS2, SBS, and tvN aired the highest number of Korean drama series, with peaks on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Data were collected from the publicly available website mydramalist.com, where users contribute information about Asian TV shows and movies. The dataset includes 810 distinct shows spanning from 2002 to 2022. No statistical tests were performed.\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\nThis graph illustrates that Tuesday and Wednesday are the most popular days for airing dramas across multiple networks. Conversely, Sundays and Fridays show relatively lower activity in terms of drama releases, indicating a preference for mid-week broadcasting. One possible explanation for these trends due to market demands. Sunday is the final weekend day which leads to lower viewership while the reason Friday has less demand might be due to overtime working/studying schedule or the population at large going out and not staying at home watching TV. Another notable observation would be that the top four networks dominated the market where KBS, MBC and SBS are public television networks and tvN is a private one. Each network also have their own airing strategies as tvN aired the most shows on Saturday, KBS on Monday and Tuesday while MBC have the highest proportion on Wednesday and Thursday. We can also observed that investment in the public sector (KBS, SBS) is as important as the private sector (tvN) for the television industry as the government heavily subsided the industry through investment in film education from the Korean Film Academy, interest-free or low-interest loans for enterprise 3 and tax policies4 that encourage local business to invest in film production beside their own direct investment to the industry 5.\n\n\n\n\nOn March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic 6 that continued to last for the next 3 years. Following the announcement was a string of global and national shutdowns. Because of that, more people spent more time inside watching shows on Netflix and got to learn more about Korean drama. In this section, we would like to look at Korean drama series on Netflix to identify changes in the number of drama series as well as the most popular genres among the series before and after the Covid pandemic. We have decided to use “2020” as a mark for before and after Covid pandemic instead of “March 2020” for simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The number of Korean drama series on Netflix after 2020 is two times greater than the number of Korean shows on Netflix before 2020. The data were collected from mydramalist.com and include IMDb ratings for 810 dramas spanning from 2002 to 2022. The years were grouped into two categorical groups for comparison. No statistical tests were performed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe briefly look at the number of Korean drama shows on Netflix before 2020 and after 2020 and see that after the announcement of the COVID-19 a global pandemic up until 2022, Netflix has added 36 more Korean drama shows into their collection, showing Netflix’s interest in investing into Korean shows in these recent years. Naturally, our next question would be “Then does Netflix have a preference of Korean drama shows’ genres that they want to add that can attract more viewers?” We look at this question in the following graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Top 5 Korean Drama Genres on Netflix from 2016 to 2022. The red vertical line marks the transition year 2020. Shows with omance genres exhibited the fastest growth, peaking at around 155 in 2020. Data were sourced from the publicly available website mydramalist.com, where users contribute information about Asian TV shows and movies. No statistical tests were conducted.\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\nThis graph indicates a shift in focus toward action and romance genres while reducing investment in thriller and comedy content from Netflix in Kdrama. We can see that romance dramas experienced a sharp increase, peaking around 2020, followed by a slight decline but maintaining it’s top position even in 2022. The action genres initially grew at a slower pace but also grew significantly after 2020. Mystery and thriller genres followed similar trajectories, with significant activity between 2018 and 2020 but a noticeable decline after 2021. Comedy dramas showed a slower growing trend which peaked in 2019 and then declined gradually. The red vertical line marking 2020 reflects the impact of a pandemic which might change production priorities and viewer preferences."

Among these original networks, Netflix is one of a few original network that is a streaming service, but it is doing very well. As Netflix is a global streaming service, this suggests Netflix’s original Korean dramas are doing very well and receiving a lot of attention from global audience. This relates to the concept of soft power we discuss in the introduction where Korean culture and values are getting recognition from the international level.\n\n\n\n\nOne way to examine the strategy to their success would be through the classic strategy of TV networks in their choice of aired day to be competitive with other networks. We will visualized that concept through the top 10 original networks below.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Number of Korean Drama Series by Days of the Week Across Top 10 Original Networks. This chart shows that KBS2, SBS, and tvN aired the highest number of Korean drama series, with peaks on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday. Data were collected from the publicly available website mydramalist.com, where users contribute information about Asian TV shows and movies. The dataset includes 810 distinct shows spanning from 2002 to 2022. No statistical tests were performed.\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\nThis graph illustrates that Tuesday and Wednesday are the most popular days for airing dramas across multiple networks. Conversely, Sundays and Fridays show relatively lower activity in terms of drama releases, indicating a preference for mid-week broadcasting. One possible explanation for these trends due to market demands. Sunday is the final weekend day which leads to lower viewership while the reason Friday has less demand might be due to overtime working/studying schedule or the population at large going out and not staying at home watching TV. Another notable observation would be that the top four networks dominated the market where KBS, MBC and SBS are public television networks and tvN is a private one. Each network also have their own airing strategies as tvN aired the most shows on Saturday, KBS on Monday and Tuesday while MBC have the highest proportion on Wednesday and Thursday. We can also observed that investment in the public sector (KBS, SBS) is as important as the private sector (tvN) for the television industry as the government heavily subsided the industry through investment in film education from the Korean Film Academy, interest-free or low-interest loans for enterprise 3 and tax policies4 that encourage local business to invest in film production beside their own direct investment to the industry 5.\n\n\n\n\nOn March 11, 2020, WHO declared COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic 6 that continued to last for the next 3 years. Following the announcement was a string of global and national shutdowns. Because of that, more people spent more time inside watching shows on Netflix and got to learn more about Korean drama. In this section, we would like to look at Korean drama series on Netflix to identify changes in the number of drama series as well as the most popular genres among the series before and after the Covid pandemic. We have decided to use “2020” as a mark for before and after Covid pandemic instead of “March 2020” for simplicity.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: The number of Korean drama series on Netflix after 2020 is two times greater than the number of Korean shows on Netflix before 2020. The data were collected from mydramalist.com and include IMDb ratings for 810 dramas spanning from 2002 to 2022. The years were grouped into two categorical groups for comparison. No statistical tests were performed.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe briefly look at the number of Korean drama shows on Netflix before 2020 and after 2020 and see that after the announcement of the COVID-19 a global pandemic up until 2022, Netflix has added 36 more Korean drama shows into their collection, showing Netflix’s interest in investing into Korean shows in these recent years. Naturally, our next question would be “Then does Netflix have a preference of Korean drama shows’ genres that they want to add that can attract more viewers?” We look at this question in the following graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Top 5 Korean Drama Genres on Netflix from 2016 to 2022. The red vertical line marks the transition year 2020. Shows with omance genres exhibited the fastest growth, peaking at around 155 in 2020. Data were sourced from the publicly available website mydramalist.com, where users contribute information about Asian TV shows and movies. No statistical tests were conducted.\n\n\n\n\nObservation\n\nThis graph indicates a shift in focus toward action and romance genres while reducing investment in thriller and comedy content from Netflix in Kdrama. We can see that romance dramas experienced a sharp increase, peaking around 2020, followed by a slight decline but maintaining it’s top position even in 2022. The action genres initially grew at a slower pace but also grew significantly after 2020. Mystery and thriller genres followed similar trajectories, with significant activity between 2018 and 2020 but a noticeable decline after 2021. Comedy dramas showed a slower growing trend which peaked in 2019 and then declined gradually. The red vertical line marking 2020 reflects the impact of a pandemic which might change production priorities and viewer preferences."

We see that overall, the Korean drama industry is investing a lot into their shows so that the shows can be known more globally. As a result of their strategy and popularity of Korean drama, these shows receive more investment from Netflix and appear on the streaming service more, which makes a big profit for Netflix while as the same time receive worldwide popularity. We believe that Korean drama shows will continue to thrive even more in the future."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\n      As Asian-Americans are considered the fastest growing minority group in the U.S, and emerge as the largest group of new immigration (Cohn, 2015), understanding the progress, setbacks, and their current status might better explain trends within the Asian-American demographic and predict future immigration trends in the U.S. This is especially pertinent as they are one of the most understudied minority groups (Ðoàn et al., 2019). Therefore, we would like our research to answer the question: What is the role of age, income, mental health, length of residency, and English skill in predicting our response variable of interest: Quality of Life (QoL). Our null hypothesis is that these predictors are equal to zero. Our alternative hypothesis suggests that at least one of these four predictors is not equal to zero.\n      Literature on this topic provides a diverse list of factors that influence Asian-American Quality of Life (AAQoL). A Pew Research Center study found that the majority of Asian immigrants in the U.S. (77%) believe that their standard of living is higher than their parents’, but under half (48%) think their children’s standard of living will be better than theirs (Tian et al., 2024). For U.S.-born Asian adults, these proportions drop to 60% and 29%, respectively. (Tian et al., 2024). This illustrates the importance of birthplace in influencing quality of life. In Hawaii, studies have found that multi-ethnic Asian-Americans reported higher satisfaction with both mental and physical health compared to their mono-ethnic counterparts in some way (Zhang, 2011). One possible explanation for such a discrepancy is that multi-ethnic individuals have to navigate complex social networks, which bring more social benefits and increased fulfillment. Meanwhile, a different study has found that young Asian-Americans are isolated from their families due to their unmarried status (Jang et al., 2021). Additionally, middle-aged Asian-Americans from 40 to 59 years old have the highest odds of being socially isolated due to their limited English proficiency (Jang et al., 2021). This trend is worth noting as social isolation has been considered a health risk factor comparable to smoking 15 cigarettes a day (Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015). Moreover, limited English proficiency also plays a role in Asian-Americans’ lower participation in health services (Jang & Kim, 2018), which could potentially delay and complicate underlying health conditions, especially with avoidance of treatment and regular check-ups. These references complicate an already-complex argument and will be crucial in providing a more objective and all-encompassing assessment of quality of life for our interpretation.\n.\n\n\nMaterial & Method\n      We utilize a dataset from “The Final Report on the Asian American Quality of Life”, located on the data.austintexas.gov website, the official City of Austin data portal. The report was submitted in October 2016 under the lead of Dr. Yuri Jang from the University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work. This data derives from large-scale paper surveys distributed to Asian-American residents of Austin, Texas, through 76 survey sessions across 891 survey sites selected based on the Austin Asian Community Resource Database from August to December, 2015. They include city public centers, educational facilities, medical establishments, religious institutions, local businesses (such as restaurants and grocery stores), and other social services providers. Notably, Asian-Americans are defined in the report as “individuals having origins in any of the original peoples of the Far East, Southeast Asia, or the Indian subcontinent” aged 18 and above. It took about 20 min for each participant to complete the questionnaire, and respondents were each paid U.S. $10 for their participation. The dataset included 2609 unique observations and 231 variables covering many diverse topics. Some are picked from existing national and state surveys, including information on demographics, immigration and acculturation, health, emotional wellbeing, special interests, social and community resources, and general living conditions in Austin. They were collected in Texas as this state displays the highest U.S. growth rate for Asian-American populations, with a 72.4% increase from 2000 to 2010 (City of Austin, Texas, 2018). Austin also currently houses an estimated 110,000 to 115,000 Asian residents, second only to Houston, Texas (City of Austin, Texas, 2018). Our dataset highlights an ever-increasing population, and while our findings may not apply to other states with slower growth rates, they will prove pertinent in recognizing patterns, as the proportion of Asian-Americans in the United States is projected to increase from 5.6% to 10% by 2050 (City of Austin, Texas, 2018).\n      We are dealing with a relatively robust dataset that has been well-constructed. As a result, the data was mess-free, and we did not need to clean anything. Our only problem was the presence of NAs in our observed variables. Due to our large sample size of 2565 observations in total after removing 267 observations that contain NAs from our variables of interest, we decided it was appropriate to simply remove them, as we have a sufficient number of datapoints left. Our summary statistics can be seen in the tables below. Table 1 focuses on categorical variables by showing the proportion of the levels per variable. For example, household income in USD annually has been divided into 2 groups: under $70,000 and above that, as 42% of the sample have income of over $70,000. Mental health is also reported with proportions, including 5 groupings from ‘Poor’ to ‘Excellent’. On the other hand, our numerical summary statistic is calculated in Table 2 with the mean and standard deviation, plus the number of missing values (NAs) we removed from the dataset per variable (column).\n      Since quality of life is a numeric response variable, and there are multiple predictors presented, we believe it is reasonable to use the Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. Initially, we composed a full model with 12 variables as shown in Table 1, and built an MLR model utilizing all of them. Although this model explained the most variability in the dataset (Adjusted R-squared = 0.285), there were concerns about multicollinearity. To achieve a simpler, more straightforward model in mind, we first selected the best suited three subset that do not contain confounding variables based on significance (by a two-sided t-test) and relevancy (regarding the context of the survey). Then, limit them to only one promising subset including ‘Age’, ‘Income’, ‘Present Mental Health’, ‘Duration of Residency’, and ‘English Difficulties’. However, we suspected that ‘Income’ might not be as significant in the subset, so a nested F-test was performed for a model with ‘Income’ and one without. Consequently, our test results indicated that the model with ‘Income’ is statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). Therefore, we decided to examine quality of life with age, income, duration of residency, present mental health, and English speaking difficulties as the final predictors. In our initial Exploratory Data Analysis, the QoL score is skewed left, but since we wanted to make it skewed right and take a log transformation, we decided to transform QoL score and create a new variable called \\(log_{quality}\\) which can be calculated using this following formula: \\(log_{quality} = log(11-QoL)\\). After finding the estimated coefficients from the MLR model, we applied the formula \\(1/(e^{-estimate})\\) to retransform the QoL scores.\n\n\nResults\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Categorical Variables Summary Statistics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nMissing values\nN = 2,5651\n\n\n\n\nEthnicity\n0\n\n\n\n\n    Asian Indian\n\n\n568 (22%)\n\n\n    Chinese\n\n\n630 (25%)\n\n\n    Filipino\n\n\n262 (10%)\n\n\n    Korean\n\n\n467 (18%)\n\n\n    Other\n\n\n143 (5.6%)\n\n\n    Vietnamese\n\n\n495 (19%)\n\n\nMarital Status\n13\n\n\n\n\n    Living with a partner\n\n\n102 (4.0%)\n\n\n    Married\n\n\n1,704 (67%)\n\n\n    Other\n\n\n29 (1.1%)\n\n\n    Single\n\n\n717 (28%)\n\n\nIncome (US dollars)\n187\n\n\n\n\n    under70k\n\n\n1,390 (58%)\n\n\n    over70k\n\n\n988 (42%)\n\n\nPresent Mental Health\n9\n\n\n\n\n    Excellent\n\n\n630 (25%)\n\n\n    Fair\n\n\n190 (7.4%)\n\n\n    Good\n\n\n720 (28%)\n\n\n    Poor\n\n\n28 (1.1%)\n\n\n    Very Good\n\n\n988 (39%)\n\n\nEnglish Difficulties\n31\n\n\n\n\n    Much\n\n\n541 (21%)\n\n\n    Not at all\n\n\n765 (30%)\n\n\n    Not much\n\n\n723 (29%)\n\n\n    Very much\n\n\n505 (20%)\n\n\n\n1 n (%)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs shown in Figure 1(a), there are five levels of Present Mental Health indicate the self-reported response of participants about their state of mental health.

Holding all other variables constant, for each additional year added in age, AAQoL decreases 0.998 (0.997;0.999) times on average, while for each increment of a year of residency, AAQoL increases 1.006 (1.004;1.008) times. Our categorical variables show a similar picture with an overall positive correlation with QoL. Particularly with other variables accounted for, Asian-American whose annual household income from $70,000 and above have 1.189(1.143;1.236) times higher QoL compared to the lowest income group of $0 to $10000 on average. It is also worth noting that Asian-Americans with a “Very Good” mental health state have a QoL that is 0.739 (0.704;0.776) times lower than the people with “Excellent” mental health. Additionally, the QoL of Asian-Americans who considered their English speaking difficulty as “Not at all” was 1.167 (1.101;1.236) times larger than those who reported their difficulty as “Much”, in respect to other variables.\n\n\nDiscussion\n      The above interpretation of our coefficients is within our expectation based on established trends of higher income, better mental health, lengthening of stay and more cultural assimilation correlate to a higher degree of life satisfaction for everyone, including Asian-Americans. While aging demonstrated a negative correlation to AAQoL, the difference is not really large, and thus less meaningful when compared to the rest of the explanatory variables. Since age is in opposition with duration of residency, which means that the longer people live in a place, they have higher life satisfaction as they get used to the new location but might have lower life satisfaction due to aging, making these two variable coefficients cancel out. Our final model does not contain any confounding variables as we have eliminated them beforehand.\n      Contextually, we do not have a chance to compare variables that are related to our literature like ethnicity, marital status or household size in our final model. Thus, the relationship of the predictors we have might be strictly interpreted for correlation and not for causal relationship. While all states of mental health are related to QoL in our model, it is interesting that the supposedly worst mental health state of “Poor” has a smaller difference to “Excellent” mental health. These small discrepancy could be accounted for by the noteworthy overlapping between “Poor” state of mental health’s QoL scores to “Fair” and “Good” mental health states, with a small QoL score overlap to “Excellent” and “Very Good” in the Present Mental Health boxplot in Figure 1. The AAQoL report has noted that there is a possible lack of awareness of mental health problems among the populations as more than one third survey participants believed that depression is a sign of weakness, and almost one half have misconception of antidepressant, they think that it is addictive. The internalization of the model minority myth that all Asian-American is wealthy, highly educated and problem free (Yi et al., 2016) could exacerbate the predisposing mental health stigma of Asian-Americans which stem from Asian cultural emphasis on Asian cultural values like emotional restrain, shame avoidance, and saving face (Shea & Yeh, 2008). These results are making the case for a nuanced approach of providing Asian-Americans, especially immigrants the anticipated help they need.\n      However, one limitation from our model is variability with the income groups, where the over $70,000 group is disproportionately represented of almost half the sample. Self-assessed mental health might be underestimated due to stigma while English difficulties could be overestimated from actual capability. While Austin serves as an excellent sample of the Asian population’s life experience, it might overrepresent the new immigration population with much higher income or average income of the American middle-class. Future study could further survey other cities in different states, such as California that also experience an increase of Asian immigration and also expand our research to different racial groups and ethnicities. The same AAQoL survey could also be re-introduced as it has been almost 10 years since this report and new insight could be made between the first and the second future report.\n\n\n\nBibliography\nCity of Austin, Texas.
